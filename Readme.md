# SwiftLintPy

Demo of custom SwiftLint rules written in Python to handle a swift source code structure.

To proceed swift structures it uses [SourceKitten framework](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten).

Demo limited to proceed only one rule.

## Idea

Lightweight SwiftLint rules written in Python to make it easier to write custom rules and make it more flexible.

Goal: place rules near the code they are checkin to make it easier to maintain and extend for team work.
